# Project 

## Project rules 
- Choose and share your idea with the teachers before 01.11
- You are working on the project until the end of the course
- You can work in groups (you should tell us that you are working in a group)
- Try to use what we learnt during the course
- You can use something that was not covered during the course
- You can (but don't have to) use one of our ideas

## Project ideas :bulb: :bulb: :bulb: 
### Text analysis :book: 
#### Description:
A user can enter a text using the console. The application should calculate a statistics and show it to the user:

- amount of the sentences
- amount of the words
- the longest word
- the longest sentence
- top 5 the most popular words in the text 
#### Bonus: :arrow_upper_right:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- Read a text from a file
- Application receives a path to a folder, checks all files in this folder and create a statistics as a json file for 
each file + a statistics for the folder, that contains: 
    - How many files were processed
    - The biggest text
    - The smallest text
    - The longest sentence
    - The longest word
    - The top 5 the most popular words across all the texts
- Add tests for your application

#### You will use from the course: :white_check_mark:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself: :mag: 
- String operations

### Phone Index :iphone: 
#### Description:
A user can enter a text using the console. Which contains phone number and name and they should be able to 
- save number
- add new numbers later
- search for contact by name or phone number

#### Bonus: :arrow_upper_right:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- user can search for number and delete it from phone index

#### You will use from the course: :white_check_mark:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself: :mag: 
- String operations

### Accounting software üìà
#### Description:
A user can enter expenses and earnings using a console. They should be able to:
- retrieve all previously inserted expenses and earnings
- receive summaries and balances
- save and load data to and from file, to use it later on

#### Bonus: :arrow_upper_right:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- have a simple user management system that allows different users to register and log in the system, and store their data in different files
- use a real db!

#### You will use from the course: :white_check_mark:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself: :mag: 
- String operations
- Potentially, simple database operations

### Twitter analysis üê¶
#### Description:
A lot of things are said on Twitter every day - the analysis of tweets can be very valuable!
The user of your program should be able to select a tag/topic, anx the program could fetch the last tweets on the topic and return some basic statistics

- most mentioned words (removing very common words?)
- most used emojis
- most active user

#### Bonus: :arrow_upper_right:
If you finished the exercise, here some ideas how you can make it more complex and use something else:

- you could use a graphing library to actually output nice graphs!

#### You will use from the course: :white_check_mark:
- OOP
- Data Structures 
- Tests
- File IO

#### You will need to learn yourself: :mag: 
- using Twitter Java API (maybe [http://twitter4j.org/en/](http://twitter4j.org/en/)? )
- potentially, using a graphing library
