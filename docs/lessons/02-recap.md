## Exercises

Create a new Java file for each exercise, named Exercise1 to Exercise4.

### Exercise 1 - easy

Write a Java program to display the following pattern.

```
   J    a   v     v  a                                                  
   J   a a   v   v  a a                                                 
J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa                                                
 JJ  a     a   V  a     a
```

If you don't know where to start, try creating a new Java class called Exercice1 and copy-pasting the following into it!

```java
public class Exercice1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        print();
    }

    public static void print() {
        // your code needs to go here!
    }
}
```
### Exercise 2 - easy
Write a Java program to reverse a string. Go to the editor
Input Data:
```
Any String, e.g.: The quick brown fox
```

Expected Output:
```
Reverse string: xof nworb kciuq ehT
```
### Exercise 3 - medium
Write a Java program and compute the sum of the digits of an integer.
Do this with a separate method having the following notation:
```java
    public static int getSumOfDigits(int number) {
        // your code needs to go here!
    }
```
Input Data:
``` 
Any integer, e.g.: 25
```
Expected Output
```
The sum of the digits is: 7
```

### Exercise 4 - hard

Write a Java program to create and display unique three-digit number using 1, 2, 3, 4.

Hint: You need nested for loops.

Hint2: There are 24 numbers.

### Homework

Finish the one from Monday + if possible today's tasks.
