## Goals
- Apply OOP knowledge to real life project
- Create classes, interfaces, inheritance, constructors, overriding, ... 

## Task description
We are building the Restaurant System ! Find a name for your Restaurant :taco::hamburger:

### Minimum objects:
 - Restaurant
 - Menu
 - Dish
  - Starter
  - Main Course
  - Dessert :shaved_ice:
 - Bill  :money_mouth_face:

Menu of the restaurant should have at least 2 items per category. 
(You can store a pre defined list of items). 
Each item of the menu should have a price and some description.

### Minimum features:
- View the menu
- Place an order with any combination of the items
- Calculate the final bill and print in a nice user friendly way :money_with_wings:

### How to make it more complex: :arrow_upper_right:
 - Hint 1: Add drinks to the menu of your restaurant :tropical_drink:
 - Hint 2: Add different ingredients to the items (Ingredient class? for example, meat, vegetables, …) :tomato:
 - Hint 3: Add characteristics of your dishes (for example, is it vegetarian/vegan/gluten free)
 - Hint 4: Characteristics can be based on the ingredients (for example, if there is no meat ingredients the dish is 
 vegetarian)
 - Hint 5: A Customer can order a custom amount of items (for example, some of the customers don’t want to order a 
 dessert)
 - Hint 6: Load your menu from a file :file_folder:
 - Hint 7: Modify menu from the console (Add/Delete items)
 - Hint 8: Add waiters to your restaurant, who can take the order
 - Hint 9: Can do inventory management for the restaurant. (for example, is there enough items to cook a dish?)
 - Place for your creativity: Think what else can be in your Restaurant! What actions in the restaurant can be 
 present as classes/objects, what are their states, what behaviors/actions in the restaurant you can present with Java?
