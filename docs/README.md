# Welcome

Welcome to the website of **ReDI School's Intermediate Java** course. On this site we collect all the materials, slides, homeworks, links to videos as well as additional resources that will be useful during the course and hopefully afterwards.

If you attended the course during one of the previous semesters, you can also find the materials used for your specific course in the _Previous Semesters_ section.

## Course Goal

After finishing this course, you should have a very good understanding of the Java programming language, especially of Object Oriented programming and of the most common data structures. You will be also introduced to practices used in real world programming - managing source code with Git, using build tools like Maven, using third party libraries that provide ready-to-use functionality and unit testing. If there is enough time, we will spend a couple of lessons on solving algorithmic puzzles - something you may expect when going to the job interview.

Does it mean that after finishing the course you are ready to get a job? Most likely - not. You will be at the point where you can choose which Java developer path you want to follow - Android or backend - and then continue learning topics more specific to these job profiles.

## Course Organisation

- We meet every Monday and Wednesday, 7-9 PM
